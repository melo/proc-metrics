=head1 NAME

Proc::CPUUsage - measures the percentage of CPU the current process is using


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cpu = Proc::CPUUsage->new;
    my $usage1 = $cpu->usage; ## returns usage since new()
    my $usage2 = $cpu->usage; ## returns usage since last usage()
    ...


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to measure how much CPU your perl process is
using.

The construction of the object defines the inital values. Each call to
L</"usage()"> returns the CPU usage since the last call to L</"new()"> or
L</"usage()">.

The value returned is normalised between 0 and 1, the latter being
100% usage.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

    $cpu = Proc::CPUUsage->new()

Creates a new L<Proc::CPUUsage|Proc::CPUUsage> object with the current values for CPU usage.


=head2 usage()

    $usage = $cpu->usage()

Returns the CPU usage since the last call to L</"new()"> or L</"usage()">.

The value returned is greater than 0 and lower or equal to 1.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<AnyEvent::Monitor::CPU|AnyEvent::Monitor::CPU> for a more practical use for this module.
